<ul>
  <li>
    So this article is divided into 5 C(s) which are Create, Consume,
    Coordinate, Connect and Cerebrate. Yes, this structure is from Ali Abdaal
    but it works well so why not use it.
  </li>
  <li>
    CREATE
    <ul>
      <li>
        This category contains all the pieces of software that I use in-order to
        create stuff. That may be articles, websites, newsletters. So lets get
        into it
      </li>
      <li>
        The first app is the one, the only Roam Research
        <ul>
          <li>
            Roam Research is just such an awesome tool. You can implement the
            Resonance Calendar System popularised by Ali Abdaal so efficiently.
            the backlink functionality is just amazing. I use it daily and
            extensively. if for some reason, I could use Roam Research, I would
            have a pretty hard time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Here is a picture of my graph
            <ul>
              <li>
                <img
                  className="img-fluid"
                  src="./images/roam-rectangle-light.png"
                  alt=""
                />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Notion
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is the tool that I use for project management. I have a number
            of projects going on, and Notion helps me to keep track of
            everything. I don&#39;t use it as much as I used to because Roam
            Research has replaced many of its functions but still there are so
            functions of Notion that I Roam Research does have. It sure is a
            great app
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        OneNote
        <ul>
          <li>
            As you know, I love Physics and Maths. I can use Latex and can type
            kinda fast but still doing Physics and Maths in Latex is kinda
            cumbersome. I am not going to solve whole problems in latex. I
            don&#39;t also like using paper, you can end up with piles of paper
            which you are not sure whether to discard or keep. So, I use OneNote
            and write using the Surface pen.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        PyCharm
        <ul>
          <li>
            The main language that I use for programming is Python and in my
            opinion, PyCharm is the best Python IDLE.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Visual Studio Code
        <ul>
          <li>
            I have very recently started to learn some app development using
            flutter and I use Visual Studio Code as my IDLE of choice for that
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Sublime Text
        <ul>
          <li>
            I have hand coded this website in HTML and CSS with a sprinkle of
            JS. Sublime text is one of the best IDLE(s) for web development.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The Command Prompt
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fine this is mostly for LOLs. But yes I use the command prompt quite
            a lot. I don&#39;t use it that much now, but when I was learning
            Django, I used it a lot.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        GitHub desktop
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is the app that I use to communicate from my computer to my
            GitHub repository. This site is hosted using GitHub pages so it
            helps if I can easily change my code and commit changes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    CONSUME
    <ul>
      <li>
        I consume a lot of content such as Books, Audiobooks, Manga,
        Documentaries and yes, YouTube videos. Here are the apps that I most
        often for consuming content
      </li>
      <li>
        Audible
        <ul>
          <li>
            Audible is the single best place on earth to get your audiobooks. It
            is basically the price for knowledge you pay and it is totally worth
            it. I love listening to audiobooks and you can check out my method
            for consuming books and audiobooks here.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Reddit
        <ul>
          <li>
            Its the place for me to hangout for like 10 minutes a day. It is a
            nice place to ask questions and get answers. It gives you that kind
            of community feeling.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Shonen Jump
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is the best platform (at least in that I know of) to get some
            manga. it has basically all the manga that you will wish to read.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Google Podcasts
        <ul>
          <li>
            My podcast platform of choice is Google podcasts. It is really
            simple and it works well.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Kindle
        <ul>
          <li>
            I like to read and I use the Kindle apps and website to read my
            books
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Play books
        <ul>
          <li>
            I like their upload feature. It is better than the kindle one
            otherwise they are pretty similar.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Twitter
        <ul>
          <li>The default twitter app is my twitter client</li>
          <li>
            Twitter is under the consume category because I don&#39;t really
            Connect much using Twitter
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    COORDINATE
    <ul>
      <li>
        Day One
        <ul>
          <li>It is literally the best journaling app.</li>
          <li>
            The android version is an afterthought for sure but still it is the
            best. Just go get it
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Microsoft Edge (The new Beta one)
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is the browser of my choice. I use a pretty simple Surface Go
            with 8 Gigs of RAM and frankly speaking, chrome is too heavy for it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Google Calender
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is basically the calendar app of choice. I just use it to keep my
            routine. It gives me a nice view of my routine. I haven&#39;t really
            tried a lot of calendar apps and I find that the Google Calendar app
            works fine.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        OneDrive
        <ul>
          <li>
            I backup my pictures, documents. It is a grate service and I love
            using it. I would have gone for Google Drive but I subscribe to
            Microsoft 365 and 1 TB of OneDrive storage is included so I just use
            OneDrive.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Power Toys
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is a fun addon for windows. I love using PowerToys run. It is
            basically the same as Windows search maybe even a touch worse but it
            is just a coolness factor.
          </li>
          <li>I also like to use PowerToys&#39; Fancy zones Feature.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Habitica
        <ul>
          <li>
            A Habit tracker is such a simple app that anyone can build it.
            Therefore the stores are flooded with habit trackers. The reason I
            prefer Habitica is the community side of things. You can join
            parties and go on quests together to defeat bosses.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    CONNECT
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gmail
        <ul>
          <li>
            I don&#39;t really care about E-Mail for now because I don&#39;t get
            that many. I just Gmail to mange the ones the emails that I receive.
          </li>
          <li>You can E-Mail me at hi@aproductivenerd.com</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Whatsapp
        <ul>
          <li>Exactly what is sounds like</li>
          <li>
            I use the desktop app because I can type way faster on my PC than on
            my phone
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    CEREBRATE
    <ul>
      <li>
        Anki
        <ul>
          <li>
            Anki is my flashcard app of choice. I use it to memorise random
            trivia or facts. Anki is not for understanding, just for memorising.
            Use it to memorise random facts not concepts
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Duolingo
        <ul>
          <li>
            Duolingo is a free way for you to learn new languages. I am learning
            Japanese and I love using Duolingo for that.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Skillshare
        <ul>
          <li>
            Skillshare is a online learning platform with a number of courses
            ranging from Productivity to Graphic Design. I have learnt all my
            HTML, CSS and JS from there and I love it.
